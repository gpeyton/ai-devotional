# Week 5: God's Providence
**Memory Verse**: "And we know that for those who love God all things work together for good." (Romans 8:28)

## Day 1: What Are God's Works of Creation?

**Weekly Memory Verse**: "And we know that for those who love God all things work together for good." (Romans 8:28)

**Question**: What are God's works of creation?
**Answer**: God's works of creation are His making all things out of nothing, by the word of His power, in six days, and all very good.

Last week, we learned amazing things about *what* God is – that He is a Spirit without limits, who has always existed and never changes. That makes us wonder, what does this all-powerful, eternal God *do*? Our first question this week looks at one of His most incredible actions: His work of creation.

Think about a painter getting ready to create a beautiful picture. They need a canvas, brushes, and lots of colorful paints, right? They start with materials that already exist. But when God created the universe, He didn't need anything to start with! The catechism answer says God made "all things out of nothing." This is incredible! He didn't find some pre-existing space dust or leftover matter. He simply spoke, and everything came into being.

The answer also tells us *how* God created: "by the word of His power." In the book of Genesis, we read again and again, "And God said..." and then whatever He said happened immediately. "Let there be light," and there was light! "Let the waters swarm with living creatures," and the seas were filled with fish! God's word is so powerful that it brings things into existence.

He did all this in "six days." God could have created everything in an instant, but He chose to do it over six distinct periods, setting a pattern of work and rest that He later gave to His people as well. On the seventh day, God rested, not because He was tired, but to show His creation was complete and perfect.

And finally, the answer tells us the result: "all very good." When God finished His work of creation, He looked at everything He had made, from the smallest insect to the brightest star, including Adam and Eve, and declared it all "very good." It was perfect, beautiful, and exactly as He intended it to be, reflecting His own goodness and glory. Although sin later damaged this perfect creation, understanding how God originally made everything helps us appreciate His power, wisdom, and goodness.

**Hymn**: How Great Thou Art

**Prayer Points**:
• Praise God for His power to create everything out of nothing
• Thank God for the beauty and goodness of His original creation
• Ask God to help us see His glory in the world around us

## Day 2: Stewardship

**Weekly Memory Verse**: "And we know that for those who love God all things work together for good." (Romans 8:28)

**Lesson Verse**: "Honor the LORD with your wealth and with the firstfruits of all your produce." (Proverbs 3:9)

Have you ever been given a special toy or game to take care of? Maybe your parents asked you to keep it clean, put it away safely, and not let it get broken. Being responsible for something that belongs to someone else is called stewardship. The Bible teaches us that everything we have—our time, our talents (things we're good at), our money, and even the earth itself—really belongs to God. He is the owner of everything, and He trusts us to be good stewards, or caretakers, of His gifts.

Our lesson verse from Proverbs tells us to "Honor the LORD with your wealth." This doesn't just mean money. It means using all the resources God gives us in a way that pleases Him. Think about the story Jesus told about the talents (Matthew 25:14-30). A master gave his servants different amounts of money ("talents") to look after while he was away. The servants who used the money wisely and made more were praised, but the servant who just hid his talent out of fear was called wicked and lazy. Jesus used this story to teach us that God expects us to use the gifts He gives us for His glory, not just keep them to ourselves.

How can we be good stewards? We can use our time wisely, helping others instead of just playing all day. We can develop our talents, like drawing, music, or sports, and use them to bring joy or help people. We can be generous with our money, giving some back to God through the church and helping those in need. We can also take care of the world God made by not being wasteful and appreciating nature.

Being a good steward starts with recognizing that everything comes from God. When we understand that, we become thankful for His gifts and want to use them in a way that honors Him, our generous Provider.

**Hymn**: Take My Life, and Let It Be

**Prayer Points**:
• Thank God for all the good gifts He has given us
• Ask God to help us be wise and faithful stewards of our time, talents, and resources
• Pray for opportunities to use God's gifts to honor Him and bless others

## Day 3: What Did God Do When He Created Man?

**Weekly Memory Verse**: "And we know that for those who love God all things work together for good." (Romans 8:28)

**Question**: What did God do when He created man?
**Answer**: God created man, male and female, after His own image, in knowledge, righteousness, and holiness, with dominion over the creatures.

When God created the world, He saved the best for last! On the sixth day, after making the land, sea, plants, and animals, Genesis tells us God said, "Let us make man in our image, after our likeness." This was the high point of creation!

What does it mean to be made in God's image? It doesn't mean we look exactly like God, because God is a Spirit. Instead, it means we are created to reflect Him in special ways. The catechism mentions three: knowledge, righteousness, and holiness.
*   **Knowledge**: Unlike animals, we can think, reason, learn about God, and know Him personally. We can understand His Word and communicate with Him through prayer.
*   **Righteousness and Holiness**: God originally created Adam and Eve with hearts that loved what was good and right. They reflected God's own perfect character before sin entered the world. Sin damaged this reflection, but the good news is that through Jesus, God helps us to once again reflect His goodness.

Being made in God's image makes every single person incredibly valuable. It doesn't matter if someone is rich or poor, tall or short, born in one country or another – every human being bears the image of God.

The catechism also says God gave humans "dominion over the creatures." This means God put Adam and Eve in charge of the earth, like gardeners in His beautiful creation. They were responsible for caring for the animals and the land, ruling over it wisely and reflecting God's good rule. This responsibility continues for us today – we are called to be caretakers of the wonderful world God has entrusted to us.

Being made in God's image is an amazing privilege! It means we are designed for a relationship with our Creator and have a special purpose in His world.

**Hymn**: Praise to the Lord, the Almighty

**Prayer Points**:
• Thank God for making us in His own image
• Ask God to help us reflect His knowledge, righteousness, and holiness
• Pray for wisdom to care for the creation He has given us dominion over

## Day 4: Sovereign

**Weekly Memory Verse**: "And we know that for those who love God all things work together for good." (Romans 8:28)

**Lesson Verse**: "The Lord has established his throne in the heavens, and his kingdom rules over all." (Psalm 103:19)

What does it mean for someone to be sovereign? It means they are the supreme ruler, the one with the highest authority and power, who is in complete control. When we say God is sovereign, we mean He is the ultimate King over everything that exists.

Our lesson verse paints a picture of God's absolute rule: "The Lord has established his throne in the heavens, and his kingdom rules over all." His throne isn't like an earthly king's throne that can be taken away; it's firmly established in heaven, the place of ultimate authority. And His kingdom isn't just over one country or people; it "rules over all"—every person, every angel, every planet, every molecule, every event in history. Nothing happens outside of His knowledge and control.

Think about when your mom or dad plans a special, fun day for you. Maybe a trip to the zoo or a picnic in the park. They plan where you'll go, pack the snacks, and make sure you get there safely. You still get to make choices during the day, like which animal to see first or what game to play, but your parent is lovingly guiding the whole day to make sure it's wonderful and good. God's sovereignty is like that, but much bigger! He is lovingly guiding everything in the whole world—people's choices, the sunshine and rain, everything—to work together according to His perfect and good plan. He is in charge, making sure His loving purposes happen.

Sometimes, things happen that we don't understand. Bad things happen to good people, and life can feel out of control. But knowing God is sovereign gives us incredible peace and confidence. It means that even in the middle of confusing or difficult times, the King of the universe is still on His throne. He hasn't lost control. He knows what He is doing, and as our weekly memory verse reminds us, He can work *all things* together for the good of those who love Him.

God's sovereignty isn't scary; it's comforting. Our all-powerful King is also perfectly good, wise, and loving. We can trust His rule completely, knowing He is always working for His glory and the good of His children.

**Hymn**: All Hail the Power of Jesus' Name

**Prayer Points**:
• Praise God for being the sovereign King over all creation
• Thank God that His rule is perfectly wise, good, and loving
• Ask for faith to trust God's sovereign plan, especially during difficult times

## Day 5: George Müller

**Weekly Memory Verse**: "And we know that for those who love God all things work together for good." (Romans 8:28)

George Müller was a man who truly loved God and believed that he would provide for every need. Born in Prussia (now part of Germany) in 1805, young George didn't live a good life. He lied and stole, even from his own father. But when he was 20 years old, he went to a Christian meeting and his life was completely changed. He felt God calling him to serve Him.

Müller moved to England and eventually felt led to start homes for orphaned children in the city of Bristol. At that time, many poor children lived on the streets with no one to care for them. Müller wanted to show the world that God was real and answered prayer. So, he decided he would never ask anyone for money or supplies for the orphanages. He would only pray and trust God to provide.

It was an amazing experiment in faith! Sometimes, there would be hundreds of children needing breakfast, and there would be no food in the house and no money to buy any. What did Müller do? He would gather the children and staff to pray. One famous story tells of a morning when the children were seated at the table with empty plates and cups. Müller prayed, thanking God for the food He would provide. Moments later, there was a knock at the door. A baker, who said God had woken him early and told him to bake bread for the orphans, stood there with fresh loaves! Soon after, another knock came—it was the milkman, whose cart had broken down right outside the orphanage. He offered the orphans his fresh milk so it wouldn't spoil!

Over his lifetime, George Müller cared for more than 10,000 orphans in the homes he built. He received millions of dollars in donations (in today's money), all without ever asking a single person except God. He kept detailed records showing how God faithfully answered thousands of prayers, often at the very last minute.

George Müller's life is a powerful example of trusting in God's sovereign providence. He knew God ruled over all and could move people's hearts to give exactly what was needed at exactly the right time. He showed everyone that God is faithful and truly does work all things together for good for those who love Him.

**Hymn**: Now Thank We All Our God

**Prayer Points**:
• Thank God for George Müller's example of faith and trust
• Ask God to help us trust Him to provide for our needs
• Pray for those who care for orphans and children in need around the world
