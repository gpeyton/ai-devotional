          "What is God? This is one of the most important questions we can ever ask! We've learned that God is our Maker and that He exists as three persons. But what is God like? The answer teaches us something amazing: God is a Spirit, and does not have a body like men.",
          "Take a deep breath. You can feel the air filling your lungs, but you can't see it. The wind can move leaves and bend trees, yet remains invisible. God is something like that—He is a Spirit. This means He doesn't have a body like we do. You can't touch Him or see Him with your eyes, but He is more real and powerful than anything else in the world!",
          "Think about when you feel happy or sad. You can't see your feelings, but they're very real! God is a Spirit, which means He doesn't have hands or feet or eyes like us. But He is more real than anything we can touch or see.",
          "Because God is a Spirit, He can do things we can't do. He never gets tired like our bodies do. He never gets sick or hurt. He doesn't need to eat food or sleep at night. And He can be everywhere at the same time, which we'll learn more about later this week!",
          "Even though we can't see God with our eyes, we can see what He does. We see His power in thunderstorms, His beauty in flowers, and His love in the people who care for us. Just like we can't see the wind but can see leaves dancing in the breeze, we know God is real because we see His wonderful works everywhere!",

        "lessonVerse": "Honor the LORD with your wealth and with the firstfruits of all your produce. (Proverbs 3:9)",
        "content": [
          "Have you ever been given a special toy or game to take care of? Maybe your parents asked you to keep it clean, put it away safely, and not let it get broken. Being responsible for something that belongs to someone else is called stewardship. The Bible teaches us that everything we have—our time, our talents (things we're good at), our money, and even the earth itself—really belongs to God. He is the owner of everything, and He trusts us to be good stewards, or caretakers, of His gifts.",
          "Our lesson verse from Proverbs tells us to \"Honor the LORD with your wealth.\" This doesn't just mean money. It means using all the resources God gives us in a way that pleases Him. Think about the story Jesus told about the talents (Matthew 25:14-30). A master gave his servants different amounts of money (\"talents\") to look after while he was away. The servants who used the money wisely and made more were praised, but the servant who just hid his talent out of fear was called wicked and lazy. Jesus used this story to teach us that God expects us to use the gifts He gives us for His glory, not just keep them to ourselves.",
          "How can we be good stewards? We can use our time wisely, helping others instead of just playing all day. We can develop our talents, like drawing, music, or sports, and use them to bring joy or help people. We can be generous with our money, giving some back to God through the church and helping those in need. We can also take care of the world God made by not being wasteful and appreciating nature.",
          "Being a good steward starts with recognizing that everything comes from God. When we understand that, we become thankful for His gifts and want to use them in a way that honors Him, our generous Provider."

          "If you look out your window, you might see trees, houses, or the sky. You can point and say, \"There's a bird!\" or \"There's our neighbor's house!\" But you can't point to just one place and say, \"There's God!\" because God is everywhere at the same time!",
          "Unlike us, God doesn't have to travel from one place to another. He doesn't have to fly in an airplane to cross the ocean or ride in a car to visit another city. Because He is a Spirit, He is present everywhere, all at once.",
          "Think about playing hide-and-seek. When you hide, your friends can't see you. But no matter where you hide, God is already there! He sees you when you're playing outside, when you're sleeping in your bed, and even when you travel far away on vacation.",
          "King David wrote about this amazing truth in Psalm 139. He said that no matter where he went—up to heaven or down to the deepest places—God was always there with him. God's presence surrounds us like the air we breathe!",
          "God being everywhere is wonderful news! It means you're never alone. When you feel scared at night, God is there with you. When you're at school, God is there too. No matter what problems you face, God is right there to help you because He is everywhere!"

          "Our lesson verse paints a picture of God's absolute rule: \"The Lord has established his throne in the heavens, and his kingdom rules over all.\" His throne isn't like an earthly king's throne that can be taken away; it's firmly established in heaven, the place of ultimate authority. And His kingdom isn't just over one country or people; it \"rules over all\"—every person, every angel, every planet, every molecule, every event in history. Nothing happens outside of His knowledge and control.",
          "Think about when your mom or dad plans a special, fun day for you. Maybe a trip to the zoo or a picnic in the park. They plan where you'll go, pack the snacks, and make sure you get there safely. You still get to make choices during the day, like which animal to see first or what game to play, but your parent is lovingly guiding the whole day to make sure it's wonderful and good. God's sovereignty is like that, but much bigger! He is lovingly guiding everything in the whole world—people's choices, the sunshine and rain, everything—to work together according to His perfect and good plan. He is in charge, making sure His loving purposes happen.",
          "Sometimes, things happen that we don't understand. Bad things happen to good people, and life can feel out of control. But knowing God is sovereign gives us incredible peace and confidence. It means that even in the middle of confusing or difficult times, the King of the universe is still on His throne. He hasn't lost control. He knows what He is doing, and as our weekly memory verse reminds us, He can work *all things* together for the good of those who love Him.",
          "God's sovereignty isn't scary; it's comforting. Our all-powerful King is also perfectly good, wise, and loving. We can trust His rule completely, knowing He is always working for His glory and the good of His children."

        "content": [
          "George Müller was a man who truly loved God and believed that he would provide for every need. Born in Prussia (now part of Germany) in 1805, young George didn't live a good life. He lied and stole, even from his own father. But when he was 20 years old, he went to a Christian meeting and his life was completely changed. He felt God calling him to serve Him.",
          "Müller moved to England and eventually felt led to start homes for orphaned children in the city of Bristol. At that time, many poor children lived on the streets with no one to care for them. Müller wanted to show the world that God was real and answered prayer. So, he decided he would never ask anyone for money or supplies for the orphanages. He would only pray and trust God to provide.",
          "It was an amazing experiment in faith! Sometimes, there would be hundreds of children needing breakfast, and there would be no food in the house and no money to buy any. What did Müller do? He would gather the children and staff to pray. One famous story tells of a morning when the children were seated at the table with empty plates and cups. Müller prayed, thanking God for the food He would provide. Moments later, there was a knock at the door. A baker, who said God had woken him early and told him to bake bread for the orphans, stood there with fresh loaves! Soon after, another knock came—it was the milkman, whose cart had broken down right outside the orphanage. He offered the orphans his fresh milk so it wouldn't spoil!",
          "Over his lifetime, George Müller cared for more than 10,000 orphans in the homes he built. He received millions of dollars in donations (in today's money), all without ever asking a single person except God. He kept detailed records showing how God faithfully answered thousands of prayers, often at the very last minute.",
          "George Müller's life is a powerful example of trusting in God's sovereign providence. He knew God ruled over all and could move people's hearts to give exactly what was needed at exactly the right time. He showed everyone that God is faithful and truly does work all things together for good for those who love Him."
