# Week 12: Christ's Offices
**Memory Verse**: "For to us a child is born, to us a son is given; and the government shall be upon his shoulder, and his name shall be called Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace." (Isaiah 9:6)

## Day 1: What Offices Does Christ Execute as Our Redeemer?

**Weekly Memory Verse**: "For to us a child is born, to us a son is given; and the government shall be upon his shoulder, and his name shall be called Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace." (Isaiah 9:6)

**Question**: What jobs does Jesus do to save us?
**Answer**: Jesus is our Prophet, our Priest, and our King, now and forever.

Think of three hats. A hard hat for building. A warm hat for winter. A sun hat for hot days. Each hat helps with a job. Jesus has three special “hats.” He is our Prophet, our Priest, and our King.

As Prophet, Jesus tells us God’s truth and shows the path. He speaks in the Bible so we can hear and obey. He shines light on our steps when life feels dark.

As Priest, Jesus gave Himself for us. On the cross He paid for sin. He brings us close to God. Right now He prays for His people and helps us when we are weak.

As King, Jesus rules with love and wisdom. He protects us from harm, leads us in what is right, and changes our hearts to want good things.

Jesus did these things on earth. He still does them in heaven. He never stops caring for His people. Our memory verse gives Him big, strong names—Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, Prince of Peace. We can trust Him with our whole lives.

**Hymn**: All Hail the Power of Jesus' Name

**Prayer Points**:
• Thank Jesus for teaching us God’s truth
• Praise Jesus for His sacrifice and care
• Worship Jesus as our strong King

## Day 2: Serving Others

**Weekly Memory Verse**: "For to us a child is born, to us a son is given; and the government shall be upon his shoulder, and his name shall be called Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace." (Isaiah 9:6)

**Lesson Verse**: "For even the Son of Man came not to be served but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many." (Mark 10:45)

Picture a majestic king who sits on a high throne. He wears a golden crown and commands an army with thousands of soldiers. Now picture that king kneeling down to help a child tie their shoes. That is a small picture of Jesus. He is the greatest King, and He came to serve.

Our verse says Jesus “came not to be served but to serve.” He did not come to boss people around. He came close to help. He washed feet. He fed people. He listened and loved. He also came “to give his life as a ransom for many.” A ransom is a price paid to set someone free, like paying to open a locked gate. On the cross, Jesus paid the full price to free His people from sin.

Because Jesus has set us free, His love now moves us to serve. Free hearts love to help. And when you do help, your heart fills with joy and gladness.

Try this today: look for one small way to serve. Share a snack. Pick up toys that are not yours. Hold a door. Use kind words. Sit by someone who is alone. Little acts can be bright lights that show what Jesus is like.

**Hymn**: Make Me a Blessing

**Prayer Points**:
• Ask God to show us simple ways to serve today
• Thank Jesus who came to serve and gave His life for us
• Pray for hearts that find joy in blessing people around us

## Day 3: How Does Christ Execute the Office of a Prophet?

**Weekly Memory Verse**: "For to us a child is born, to us a son is given; and the government shall be upon his shoulder, and his name shall be called Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace." (Isaiah 9:6)

**Question**: How is Jesus our Prophet?
**Answer**: Jesus shows us God’s will by His Word and by His Spirit.

In the Old Testament, God spoke to a man named Moses on a mountain called Mount Sinai. God gave Moses the Ten Commandments written on stone tablets. Moses came down from the mountain with his face shining bright because he had been with God. Then Moses told all the people what God had said. The people listened carefully because Moses brought them God's own words. That is like Jesus our Prophet. He brings us God's words so we can know and obey Him.

Jesus teaches us by His Word in the Bible. We read His stories and sayings. We learn who God is and how He saves us. The Spirit of Jesus opens our hearts, like opening a window to let in bright light, so we can understand and obey.

Jesus does not only point to the way. He is the Way. When we listen to His voice and follow His steps, He leads us safely home to God.

Every day we can read God's Word and pray. Jesus speaks to us through the Bible and helps us know what pleases Him. When we learn from the Bible, we grow wise and strong. We discover God's love and His plan for our lives. The Bible shows us how to be kind, how to forgive, and how to trust God when we feel scared or sad.

Jesus our Prophet never leaves us in the dark. He lights our path with His truth. He whispers peace to our hearts through His Spirit. We can talk to Him in prayer and know He always listens. His Word guides us each day as we learn to follow Him with joy.

**Hymn**: Break Thou the Bread of Life

**Prayer Points**:
• Thank Jesus for His clear Word
• Ask the Spirit to help us understand
• Praise Jesus for leading us home

## Day 4: King

**Weekly Memory Verse**: "For to us a child is born, to us a son is given; and the government shall be upon his shoulder, and his name shall be called Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace." (Isaiah 9:6)

**Lesson Verse**: "For God is the King of all the earth; sing praises with a psalm!" (Psalm 47:7)

Long ago in England, there was a good king named Alfred. When enemies came to attack his people, King Alfred led his soldiers to protect them. When his people were hungry, he made sure they had food. When they needed to learn, he built schools so children could read and write. The people loved King Alfred because he cared for them and ruled with wisdom. That is like Jesus our King. He protects us, provides for us, and rules with perfect love.

Earthly kings make mistakes. Jesus never does. He is good, strong, and kind. He rules with perfect wisdom. When we listen to King Jesus, we learn the best way to live.

Our memory verse says this King came as a child. Jesus was born for us. He still carries the government on His shoulder. One day every knee will bow to Him. Today we can bow our hearts, sing His praise, and trust His perfect rule.

His rule brings good news for our homes, our churches, and our world. When we follow King Jesus, peace and joy grow in our hearts each day. He teaches us to share, to tell the truth, and to help others. His kingdom is full of love and kindness.

We can serve King Jesus by obeying our parents, being gentle with friends, and saying our prayers. Even little children can be part of His kingdom. We do not need to wait until we grow up. Today we can choose to follow our good King and let His love shine through us to everyone we meet.

**Hymn**: Rejoice, the Lord Is King

**Prayer Points**:
• Praise Jesus as the wise King over all
• Thank Him for guiding leaders to do good
• Ask for cheerful hearts to obey our King

## Day 5: Lady Jane Grey

**Weekly Memory Verse**: "For to us a child is born, to us a son is given; and the government shall be upon his shoulder, and his name shall be called Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace." (Isaiah 9:6)

In England long ago lived a girl who loved God’s Word. Her name was Lady Jane Grey. She was born in 1537, in a time of big church changes. She learned fast and read a lot. By her teens she could read Greek and Latin, which helped her study the Bible well.

Jane’s cousin was King Edward VI. When Edward died in July 1553, some leaders made Jane queen. She was only fifteen years old. People later called her the “Nine Days’ Queen,” because her rule was very short.

Mary Tudor also wanted the crown. Mary and Jane did not agree about the Bible and the church. Mary had more soldiers and soon took the throne. Jane was put in the Tower of London, a stone fortress by the River Thames. From a window she could see the city she loved.

Wise men came and tried to change her mind about Jesus and the Bible. They promised safety if she would agree with them. Jane was calm and kind, but she would not turn from what she read in Scripture. She trusted Jesus as King and held to the truth.

On a cold morning in February 1554, Jane, now sixteen, was led into the yard of the Tower. She said a short prayer and forgave those who had hurt her. Then she said, “Lord, into thy hands I commend my spirit.” She died trusting Christ.

Why does her story matter? Jane remembered that Jesus is the true King, greater than any crown. She loved the Bible and stood firm with a gentle heart. Her courage still helps us today. We can love God’s Word, speak kindly, and trust Jesus even when it is hard.

**Hymn**: Faith of Our Fathers

**Prayer Points**:
• Thank God for courageous Christians like Lady Jane Grey who chose faithfulness over comfort
• Ask God to help us love His Word and truth as much as Jane did
• Pray for strength to follow Jesus faithfully even when it's difficult
