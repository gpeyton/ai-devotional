# Week 11: Our Redeemer
**Memory Verse**: "For God so loved the world, that he gave his only Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life." (John 3:16)

## Day 1: Who Is the Redeemer of God's Elect?

**Weekly Memory Verse**: "For God so loved the world, that he gave his only Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life." (John 3:16)

**Question**: Who saves God's chosen people?
**Answer**: Jesus Christ, God's eternal Son, is the only Savior. He became a man and is both God and man in one person forever.

Think of a lifeguard at a swimming pool. When someone is drowning, the lifeguard must jump in to save them. The lifeguard has to be strong enough to rescue the person and bring them safely to shore. Jesus is like the perfect lifeguard for our souls.

Jesus is truly God. He has all power. He knows everything. He never does anything wrong. Because He is God, He is strong enough to save everyone who trusts in Him. No problem is too big for Jesus to solve.

Jesus also became a real man. He was born as a baby, just like you were. He got hungry and tired. He felt happy and sad. He had to learn things as He grew up. Because Jesus became a man, He understands what life is like for us.

Here's something amazing: Jesus is both God and man at the same time, in one person. He didn't stop being God when He became a man. This makes Him the perfect Savior. As a man, He can take our place and die for our sins. As God, His sacrifice is powerful enough to save all His people.

Our memory verse shows us how much God loves us. The Father gave His only Son so we could live forever with Him. There is no other Savior. Only Jesus can bring us to God. We can trust Him completely because He loves us and has all power to help us.

**Hymn**: O Come, O Come, Emmanuel

**Prayer Points**:
• Thank God for sending Jesus to save us
• Praise Jesus for being both God and man
• Ask for faith to trust our Redeemer completely

## Day 2: Gratitude

**Weekly Memory Verse**: "For God so loved the world, that he gave his only Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life." (John 3:16)

**Lesson Verse**: "I will praise the name of God with a song; I will magnify him with thanksgiving." (Psalm 69:30)

Picture opening a present on your birthday. Your eyes light up with joy, and you run to hug the person who gave it to you. "Thank you!" you say with a big smile. When we see God's good gifts, our hearts should feel that same happy thankfulness.

God gives us so many wonderful things every day. The warm sun that helps flowers grow. Cool water when we're thirsty. Soft beds to sleep in. People who love us and take care of us. Even our ability to laugh and play comes from God's kind hands.

Our verse talks about praising God with songs and thanksgiving. When we say "thank you" to God, it's like using a magnifying glass on His goodness. Everything He does looks bigger and more wonderful. A thankful heart notices blessings everywhere.

Try counting God's gifts at dinner tonight. Maybe you'll think of a friend who made you laugh, or how good your food tastes, or the way your family hugs you. Each gift shows God's love for you.

The greatest gift God ever gave us is Jesus. Our memory verse reminds us that God loved us so much that He gave His only Son. When we remember Jesus dying on the cross for our sins, our hearts want to sing with thanksgiving. We can tell God "thank you" for Jesus every single day.

**Hymn**: Now Thank We All Our God

**Prayer Points**:
• Thank God for daily gifts He gives us
• Ask for eyes that notice God's blessings
• Praise God for giving Jesus, the best gift

## Day 3: How Did Christ, Being the Son of God, Become Man?

**Weekly Memory Verse**: "For God so loved the world, that he gave his only Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life." (John 3:16)

**Question**: How did God's Son become a man?
**Answer**: Jesus took a real body and a real soul. By the Holy Spirit, He was born of the virgin Mary. He never sinned.

Imagine a king who wants to visit a faraway village. He could send a messenger, but instead he decides to go himself. He puts on simple clothes and walks among his people so he can understand their lives. Jesus did something much more wonderful than this.

Jesus, the eternal Son of God, chose to become a real human being. He didn't stop being God, but He took on a human body and soul. By the powerful work of the Holy Spirit, He was born of Mary as a tiny baby in Bethlehem.

Jesus grew up just like other children. He learned to walk and talk. He helped His earthly father, Joseph, in the carpenter's shop. He got tired after long days and hungry when it was time to eat. He felt joy when He played and sadness when He saw people hurting.

But Jesus was different from every other person in one very important way: He never did anything wrong. He never disobeyed His parents. He never told a lie or was mean to anyone. He is the only perfectly good person who ever lived.

Why did Jesus become a man? So He could be our Savior! As a true man, He could live the perfect life we should have lived. As true God, His death on the cross was powerful enough to pay for all our sins. Now He understands exactly what our lives are like, and He can help us in every situation.

**Hymn**: Hark! The Herald Angels Sing

**Prayer Points**:
• Thank Jesus for becoming a man to save us
• Praise Him for living a perfect life for us
• Ask for help to follow Jesus each day

## Day 4: Redeemer

**Weekly Memory Verse**: "For God so loved the world, that he gave his only Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life." (John 3:16)

**Lesson Verse**: "Thus says the Lord, the King of Israel and his Redeemer, the Lord of hosts: 'I am the first and I am the last; besides me there is no god.'" (Isaiah 44:6)

Think about being locked in a room with no way out. You push on the door, but it won't open. You call for help, but no one can hear you. Then someone comes with the right key, unlocks the door, and sets you free. That person is your rescuer, your redeemer.

Before Jesus saved us, we were trapped by our sin. Sin is like a lock that keeps us away from God. We couldn't break free by ourselves, no matter how hard we tried. We needed someone strong enough to rescue us.

Our verse calls God both King and Redeemer. As our King, He has all authority and power. As our Redeemer, He paid the price to set us free. Jesus died on the cross to unlock the door that sin had closed. When He rose from the dead, He proved that He had defeated sin and death forever.

Now everyone who believes in Jesus belongs to God as His loved children. We don't have to be afraid anymore. We can come to God anytime and say, "Father, please help me." He hears us and cares for us every day.

The verse also reminds us that there is only one true God. No other god can save people. Only the Lord has the power to redeem us. This makes Jesus very special and precious. We can trust Him completely and tell others the good news: "Jesus sets people free!"

**Hymn**: Redeemed, How I Love to Proclaim It

**Prayer Points**:
• Thank God for setting us free through Jesus
• Praise the Lord as the only true God and Savior
• Ask for courage to tell others about Jesus

## Day 5: Charles Haddon Spurgeon

**Weekly Memory Verse**: "For God so loved the world, that he gave his only Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life." (John 3:16)

One snowy Sunday morning in England changed a teenage boy's life forever. In January 1850, fifteen-year-old Charles Spurgeon was walking through deep snow trying to find his church. The snow was so thick that he couldn't get there! Instead, he ducked into a tiny chapel in the town of Colchester to get warm.

The regular preacher couldn't come because of the storm. A simple man stood up to speak instead. He wasn't fancy or highly educated, but he opened his Bible and read these words: "Look unto me, and be ye saved" from Isaiah 45:22. Then he looked straight at young Charles and said, "Young man, you look miserable. Look to Jesus Christ and be saved!" Right there, Charles trusted Jesus as his Savior.

From that day on, Charles loved reading his Bible and talking to God in prayer. Soon he began telling small groups about Jesus. When he was only nineteen years old in 1854, he became the pastor of a church in London called New Park Street Chapel. So many people came to hear him preach that they had to build a much bigger building called the Metropolitan Tabernacle. Sometimes six thousand people packed in to hear him!

Charles didn't just preach. He cared for people who needed help. He started an orphanage to take care of children who had no families. He opened a school to train young men to become preachers. He wrote many books and sermons so people could learn about Jesus at home. People called him the "Prince of Preachers" because God used his words to help so many hearts.

What was Charles's favorite message? The same simple truth he heard as a boy: Look to Jesus and be saved! He never grew tired of telling people about God's love. He preached about our memory verse often, reminding everyone that God gave His Son so we could live forever.

We can be like Charles in simple ways. We can listen carefully when we hear God's Word. We can thank God for His love every day. We can tell a friend, "Look to Jesus!" God loves to use ordinary people like us to share His extraordinary love.

**Hymn**: Tell Me the Old, Old Story

**Prayer Points**:
• Thank God for saving Charles and using him mightily
• Ask for courage to point others to Jesus like Charles did
• Praise God for the love shown in John 3:16
