# Week 8: Disobedience and Consequences
**Memory Verse**: "For the wages of sin is death, but the free gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord." (Romans 6:23)

## Day 1: What Was the Sin Whereby Our First Parents Fell?

**Weekly Memory Verse**: "For the wages of sin is death, but the free gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord." (Romans 6:23)

**Question**: What was the sin whereby our first parents fell?
**Answer**: The sin whereby our first parents fell from the state wherein they were created, was their eating the forbidden fruit.

In the beautiful Garden of Eden, God had given Adam and Eve everything they could possibly need. Delicious fruits hung from countless trees, crystal-clear streams provided fresh water, and every animal lived in perfect harmony. Most wonderful of all, Adam and Eve could walk and talk with God Himself in the cool of the evening. Life was absolutely perfect.

But in the middle of this paradise stood one special tree - the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. God had given Adam and Eve a clear, simple command: "Of every tree of the garden you may freely eat, but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil you shall not eat, for in the day that you eat of it you shall surely die." This wasn't a difficult rule to follow, considering all the other wonderful trees they could enjoy.

Then one day, the serpent came to Eve with a tempting question: "Has God indeed said, 'You shall not eat of every tree of the garden'?" The serpent twisted God's words and planted doubt in Eve's mind. He told her, "You will not surely die. For God knows that when you eat of it your eyes will be opened, and you will be like God, knowing good and evil."

The catechism tells us exactly what happened next: Adam and Eve's sin was "their eating the forbidden fruit." It seems like such a small thing - just taking a bite of fruit. But this simple act of disobedience changed everything. They chose to believe the serpent's lie instead of trusting God's truth. They chose to go their own way instead of following God's loving command.

Our memory verse teaches us that "the wages of sin is death." A wage is what you earn for work you do. When Adam and Eve chose to sin, they earned death - not just physical death, but spiritual separation from God. But the verse doesn't end there! It also tells us about "the free gift of God" which is "eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord." Even when our first parents failed, God already had a plan to rescue them and us.

**Hymn**: Come, Thou Fount of Every Blessing

**Prayer Points**:
• Thank God for His clear commands that guide us
• Ask God to help us trust His word instead of listening to tempting lies
• Praise God for providing Jesus as the gift of eternal life

## Day 2: Foolishness

**Weekly Memory Verse**: "For the wages of sin is death, but the free gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord." (Romans 6:23)

**Lesson Verse**: "The way of a fool is right in his own eyes, but a wise man listens to advice." (Proverbs 12:15)

There once was a little boy who thought he knew better than everyone else. When his mother told him not to touch the hot stove, he thought, "She's just being mean. I know it won't hurt me." When his father warned him not to run down the steep hill, he decided, "Dad doesn't understand how good I am at running." When his teacher explained why he needed to study his math facts, he concluded, "I'm smart enough already." This little boy thought he was very wise, but he was actually being very foolish.

Our lesson verse tells us that "the way of a fool is right in his own eyes, but a wise man listens to advice." A fool is someone who thinks they know better than everyone else, especially better than God. They look at God's commands and think, "Those rules don't apply to me" or "I know a better way to live." But a wise person listens carefully to good advice, especially advice that comes from God.

This is exactly what happened in the Garden of Eden. When the serpent suggested that God was keeping something good from Adam and Eve, they began to think they knew better than God. Instead of remembering all the wonderful things God had given them and trusting His loving command, they decided to follow their own understanding. They thought they were being smart, but they were actually being foolish.

Foolishness always leads to consequences. When we ignore wise advice from our parents, teachers, or God's Word, we often end up getting hurt or hurting others. The little boy who touched the hot stove got burned. The child who ran down the steep hill fell and scraped his knees. And Adam and Eve, who thought they knew better than God, brought sin and death into the world.

But here's the wonderful news from our memory verse: even though "the wages of sin is death," God offers us "the free gift of eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord." God doesn't leave us trapped in our foolishness. He provides wisdom through His Word and salvation through His Son. When we admit our foolishness and turn to God, He forgives us and gives us His wisdom to live the right way.

**Hymn**: Teach Me Thy Way, O Lord

**Prayer Points**:
• Ask God to help us recognize when we're being foolish
• Thank God for wise people in our lives who give us good advice
• Pray for humble hearts that listen to God's wisdom instead of trusting only ourselves

## Day 3: Did All Mankind Fall in Adam's First Transgression?

**Weekly Memory Verse**: "For the wages of sin is death, but the free gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord." (Romans 6:23)

**Question**: Did all mankind fall in Adam's first transgression?
**Answer**: The covenant being made with Adam, not only for himself, but for his posterity; all mankind, descending from him by ordinary generation, sinned in him, and fell with him, in his first transgression.

Sometimes when one person makes a choice, it affects many other people too. If a ship's captain decides to sail into a dangerous storm, everyone on the ship faces the same danger. If a family's father decides to move to a new city, the whole family moves with him. In a similar but much more serious way, when Adam chose to disobey God, his choice affected every person who would ever be born.

The catechism explains this with some big words, but the idea is important to understand. When God made His covenant (His special agreement) with Adam, He wasn't just making it with Adam alone. He was making it with Adam as the representative of all people who would come after him. Adam was like the captain of the ship of humanity, and when he chose to disobey God, everyone on the ship was affected.

This means that all of us - you, me, your parents, your grandparents, and every person who has ever lived - "sinned in him, and fell with him." We all inherited Adam's sinful nature. Just like you might inherit your father's eye color or your mother's smile, all people inherit a heart that naturally wants to disobey God.

This might seem unfair at first, but think about it this way: if Adam had chosen to obey God, all of his descendants would have inherited his righteousness and lived in perfect fellowship with God forever. Adam had the chance to win eternal life for everyone, but sadly, he chose disobedience instead.

But here's where our memory verse brings us hope! Even though we all inherited the consequences of Adam's sin, God provides a way out. Jesus came as a new representative for His people. Just as Adam's disobedience affected everyone connected to him, Jesus' perfect obedience and sacrifice can save everyone who trusts in Him. The "free gift of God" is available to all who believe, no matter how deeply they've been affected by Adam's fall.

**Hymn**: Jesus Paid It All

**Prayer Points**:
• Thank God for helping us understand how sin affects everyone
• Praise Jesus for being our perfect representative who never failed
• Ask God to help us trust in Jesus rather than trying to save ourselves

## Day 4: Wrathful

**Weekly Memory Verse**: "For the wages of sin is death, but the free gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord." (Romans 6:23)

**Lesson Verse**: "For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men." (Romans 1:18)

When you see someone being mean to a smaller child on the playground, how do you feel? If you have a good heart, you probably feel angry about the unfairness and want to protect the child who's being hurt. That anger against wrongdoing is actually a good thing - it shows you care about what's right and fair. God has this same kind of feeling, but His is perfect and completely just.

Our lesson verse tells us about "the wrath of God" that is "revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness." God's wrath isn't like when we get angry because we didn't get our way or someone annoyed us. God's wrath is His perfect, holy anger against sin and evil. Because God is perfectly good and loves what is right, He must be opposed to everything that is wrong.

Think about a loving father who sees someone trying to hurt his children. The father's anger comes from his love - he's angry because he cares so much about protecting what is precious to him. God's wrath works the same way. He is angry at sin because sin hurts and destroys the people He loves. Sin breaks relationships, causes pain, and separates people from the good life God designed for them.

This is why our memory verse says "the wages of sin is death." When we choose to sin, we earn God's wrath and judgment. This should make us take sin very seriously. We can't just shrug our shoulders and say, "Oh well, everyone sins sometimes." Sin is a big deal because it offends our holy God and damages His creation.

But here's the amazing part of the story: the same verse that tells us about earning death also tells us about God's "free gift of eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord." God's love found a way to satisfy His wrath. Jesus took the punishment that our sins deserved, so God's wrath was poured out on Him instead of on us. Now, instead of facing God's anger, those who trust in Jesus receive His love and forgiveness.

**Hymn**: There Is a Fountain Filled with Blood

**Prayer Points**:
• Thank God that His wrath against sin shows how much He loves what is good
• Praise Jesus for taking God's wrath upon Himself for our sins
• Ask God to help us take sin seriously and turn to Jesus for forgiveness

## Day 5: Jonathan Edwards

**Weekly Memory Verse**: "For the wages of sin is death, but the free gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord." (Romans 6:23)

In colonial America, there lived one of the most important pastors in American history - Jonathan Edwards. Born in 1703 in Connecticut, Jonathan was incredibly smart from a young age. He loved to study everything, from tiny spiders to big ideas about God. He was so brilliant that he entered Yale College when he was only thirteen years old!

Jonathan became a pastor and one of America's greatest preachers and thinkers. He was the leader of something called the Great Awakening, a time when thousands of people across the American colonies came to know Jesus for the first time. Jonathan's powerful preaching helped start this amazing movement where entire towns and cities turned to God. Churches that had been nearly empty suddenly filled with people eager to learn about Jesus.

What made Jonathan so special was how he could explain deep truths about God in ways that ordinary people could understand. He wrote many important books that helped people think more clearly about who God is and how much He loves us. Even today, almost 300 years later, pastors and teachers still read Jonathan's writings to learn how to explain God's truth better.

Jonathan was also a loving family man. He and his wife Sarah had eleven children, and he made sure to teach each one about God's love. Amazingly, Jonathan's family produced many famous Americans - including a future vice president! Many of his children and grandchildren became pastors, teachers, and leaders who continued to serve God and help others.

Later in life, Jonathan became the president of Princeton College (now Princeton University), but sadly, he died just a few weeks after starting this new job. He had received a smallpox vaccination, which was very new at that time, but it made him sick and he went to be with Jesus in 1758.

Jonathan Edwards is remembered as one of the most important Christian leaders in American history because he helped so many people understand the Bible and come to know Jesus. He showed that you can be very smart and still have a simple, childlike faith in God. His life reminds us that God can use anyone - even a young person who loves to study - to do great things for His kingdom.

**Hymn**: Before the Throne of God Above

**Prayer Points**:
• Thank God for people like Jonathan Edwards who devoted their lives to serving Him
• Ask God to help us see His goodness in the world around us like Jonathan did
• Pray that we would love God with our whole heart, mind, and strength
