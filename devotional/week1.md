# Week 1: The Creator God

## Day 1: Who Made You?

**Weekly Memory Verse**: "In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth." (Genesis 1:1)

**Question**: Who made you?
**Answer**: God made me.

Look at your hands. Wiggle your fingers. Tap your feet. Everything your body can do is amazing! Have you ever wondered who gave you these wonderful abilities?

Long ago, God spoke the entire universe into being. He said, "Let there be light," and suddenly light filled the darkness. He made land, seas, plants, sun, moon, and animals. But when it came to people, God did something special.

The Bible tells us in Genesis that God formed Adam from dust, then breathed His own breath of life into him. For Eve, God used one of Adam's ribs. God didn't just speak people into existence—He crafted us carefully with His hands.

Imagine a potter working with clay. The potter starts with a shapeless lump and carefully forms it into something beautiful. In the same way, God knew exactly what He was doing when He made you!

In Psalm 139, David wrote that God knit us together in our mother's womb. Every part of you—your eyes, hair, laugh, even your fingerprints—was designed by God. No one else in the whole world is exactly like you!

Why did God make you? He made you because He loves you and wants you to know Him. Of all creatures, only people can talk with God, learn about Him, and love Him back. What an amazing gift!

**Hymn**: All Things Bright and Beautiful

**Prayer Points**:
• Thank God for making you exactly as you are
• Ask God to help you use your body and mind to honor Him
• Praise God for His wonderful creativity

## Day 2: Wisdom

**Weekly Memory Verse**: "In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth." (Genesis 1:1)

**Lesson Verse**: "The beginning of wisdom is this: Get wisdom, and whatever you get, get insight." (Proverbs 4:7)

What's the most valuable thing you own? A special toy? A favorite book? In the Bible, there's something described as more precious than jewels or gold. Do you know what it is? It's wisdom!

What is wisdom? It's not just knowing facts. Wisdom means knowing what is right and good, and then doing it. It's like having a special light inside that helps you make good choices.

In Proverbs, King Solomon writes about a father teaching his son. He says, "The beginning of wisdom is this: Get wisdom!" That might sound funny—like saying "To have cookies, get cookies!" But he means we should want wisdom more than anything else.

Imagine you're on a treasure hunt with a map. Having the map is good, but it doesn't help unless you follow it! Wisdom is like that. It's not enough to know what's right—we need to do what's right too.

Where does wisdom come from? The Bible tells us that "the fear of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom" (Proverbs 9:10). This doesn't mean being scared of God. It means knowing how great God is and wanting to please Him because we love Him.

When we read the Bible, pray, and listen to people who know God, we're collecting wisdom like seashells on a beach. Each piece helps us understand God better.

Remember, wisdom isn't just for grown-ups! Even as a child, you can ask God for wisdom, and He will gladly give it to you.

**Hymn**: Joyful, Joyful, We Adore Thee

**Prayer Points**:
• Ask God to give you wisdom for daily decisions
• Thank God for teaching us through His Word
• Pray for help to not just know what's right, but to do it

## Day 3: What Else Did God Make?

**Weekly Memory Verse**: "In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth." (Genesis 1:1)

**Question**: What else did God make?
**Answer**: God made all things.

Did you ever build with blocks? You might stack them to make a tower or a house. But could you build a real tree that grows? Or a butterfly that flies? Or a star that twinkles? No—only God can make these wonders!

The Bible begins, "In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth." Everything we see came from God's creative power. He didn't need tools or materials. He simply spoke, and things appeared!

In six days, God created everything. He made light and darkness, sky and water, land and plants, sun and moon and stars, fish and birds, and animals of every kind. When He finished making people, He declared that everything was "very good."

God's creation shows His amazing power. Think about oceans so deep that parts haven't been explored! Or mountains so tall they reach above clouds! From tiny ants to enormous elephants, from coral reefs to vast deserts, God made them all.

The universe is so big that scientists say there are more stars in the sky than grains of sand on all the beaches! And yet, God knows each one. Isaiah 40:26 tells us, "Lift up your eyes on high and see: who created these? He who brings out their host by number, calling them all by name."

Even the tiniest things show God's design. Each snowflake has its own pattern. Inside a drop of pond water live thousands of tiny creatures. God made these too!

When we look at all God has made, we can't help but praise Him.

**Hymn**: This Is My Father's World

**Prayer Points**:
• Thank God for creating such a beautiful world
• Praise God for His unlimited power
• Ask God to help us care for His creation

## Day 4: Creative

**Weekly Memory Verse**: "In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth." (Genesis 1:1)

**Lesson Verse**: "How many are Your works, Lord! In wisdom You made them all; the earth is full of Your creatures." (Psalm 104:24)

When you draw a picture or build with clay, you're being creative. But have you thought about where creativity comes from?

God is the Master Creator. When we create things, we're being a little bit like Him. But there's a big difference in how we create. We need materials like paper, crayons, or blocks. God created everything from nothing! He simply spoke, and where there was nothing, suddenly light appeared, oceans formed, and animals came to life.

Imagine walking through a forest. Look at the tall trees. Listen to the birds singing. Feel the soft moss. Smell the fresh pine needles. God designed all of this—every color, sound, texture, and scent. His creativity has no limits!

Think about all the different animals God made. Some swim in oceans, others soar in the sky. Some are covered in fur, others in scales or feathers. There are creatures that glow in the dark, change colors, or sleep upside down! Each one shows God's amazing imagination.

The Bible tells us that God created people in His own image. This means we reflect Him in special ways—including our ability to create. When you write a story, sing a song, or invent a game, you're using the creativity God gave you.

In Exodus, we read about Bezalel whom God filled "with the Spirit of God, with skill, ability and knowledge in all kinds of crafts" (Exodus 31:3). God values creativity so much that He gives special creative gifts to people.

Next time you create something, remember that your creativity is a gift from the Creator of the universe.

**Hymn**: All Creatures of Our God and King

**Prayer Points**:
• Thank God for His endless creativity
• Ask God to help you use your creative gifts for good
• Praise God for the beauty He has made

## Day 5: Michael Faraday

**Weekly Memory Verse**: "In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth." (Genesis 1:1)

**Lesson Verse**: "Great are the works of the LORD, studied by all who delight in them." (Psalm 111:2)

BOOM! FLASH! Little Michael Faraday jumped as lightning lit up the sky. "How does that work?" he wondered. Even as a small boy, Michael wanted to know how God made everything work. While other children only saw scary lightning, Michael saw God's amazing power!

Michael was born in 1791 to a poor family. His father was a blacksmith who was often sick and couldn't work much. Michael only went to school long enough to learn simple reading and writing. When he was 14, he became an apprentice to a bookbinder in London. This meant he had to bind books together to make them strong and beautiful.

But God had a special plan! While fixing books, Michael got to read them too! He especially loved books about chemistry and electricity. One customer saw how curious Michael was and gave him tickets to hear the famous scientist Sir Humphry Davy give four lectures at the Royal Institution.

Michael was so excited that he took 300 pages of careful notes! He made these notes into a beautiful bound book and boldly sent it to Sir Humphry with a letter asking for a job. Sir Humphry was so impressed that he hired Michael as his assistant.

In his experiments, Michael made amazing discoveries. He found that electricity could make magnets move, and magnets could create electricity! This discovery changed the world. He invented the first electric motor that could spin around using electricity. When you see electric fans or toy cars zoom across the floor, you're seeing Michael's ideas at work!

In 1831, Michael made one of his greatest discoveries. By moving a magnet near a coil of wire, he created electric current—inventing the first electric generator. This is how we make most of our electricity today! When he showed people this invention, they asked, "What good is it?" Michael wisely replied, "What good is a newborn baby?" He knew his discovery would grow to change the world!

Through all his fame, Michael remained humble because of his deep faith in God. He belonged to a small Christian church called the Sandemanians. Every Sunday, he would set aside his scientific work to worship. He often taught Bible lessons to children, explaining God's Word just as carefully as he explained science.

Once, Queen Victoria wanted to make Michael a knight—Sir Michael Faraday—with land and money. But Michael politely refused. He didn't want fancy titles. He just wanted to discover more about God's amazing creation.

"The book of nature," Michael said, "which we have to read, is written by the finger of God." When you turn on a light, remember Michael Faraday who saw God's handiwork in every discovery!

**Hymn**: For the Beauty of the Earth

**Prayer Points**:
• Thank God for giving us curious minds to explore His creation
• Ask God to help us use our gifts to help others
• Praise God for the wonderful world He made for us to discover
