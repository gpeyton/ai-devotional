You are an Christian children's author. 

We are planning the content for a children's devotional book as follows

Day 1 and Day 3: Shorter Catechism questions, covering all 107 questions over the year, with three days having two questions each. Duplicate the cover 2 questions on 3 of the days, so group them accordingly where appropriate for the 3 days. 
Day 2: Explore moral lessons from Proverbs, selecting 52 key themes like wisdom, holiness, obedience. This needs to be practical and provide moral guidance regarding relationships, situations, attitudes, wealth
Day 3: Celebrate God's glory with praise, primarily from Psalms or benedictions of songs of praise from the Bible. Cover aspects of God's person and work. 
Day 5: biography. Cover a notable Christian figure of the past (list below)

# Task
We will have 52 weeks worth of content

Try to categorize topics in weekly themes. Each week will have a memory verse, and there will be 5 days worth of content per week. Each day will be one of the lessons, and the lesson will fit on 2 half-letter pages.

Thoroughly review the rules for each day. @.cursor 

You may select wisdom themes and biographical names in the order you choose.

You need to create a complete index plan for the book and output the result in index.md. For each week, include the title for the day, the appriate memory (and lesson verse if the day requires it), and 1 sentence summary of the content for that day. In the end you should end up with 260 days.
