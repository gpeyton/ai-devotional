# Page Structure
The following structure must be followed when drafting the page. 

# Content
Highlight key points in the life of the person, why they were influencial or impactful Christians in God's Kingdom. The text must flow naturally between paragraphs. Draw out appropriate lessons if appropriate. Ensure that your lesson is historically accurate - do not hallucinate details. Structure the story in an engaging, gripping manner that holds children's attention. And if fitting, include humorous accounts if appropriate. Do not make up fake stories. The tone must be engaging and exciting where appropriate to draw the reader in. 

 Tone must be appropriate to ages 3–5 and never condescending. Use very simple vocabulary, short sentences, and concrete images. Avoid graphic details; present difficult events with gentle, hopeful wording. Focus on the key historical details of the person's life, not generic details. 

 Include 1–2 interesting, concrete historical tidbits to make the story vivid (for example: a specific year or age, a city or place name, a short child-friendly quote, an object or artifact like a printing press or ship). Keep details brief, accurate, and age-appropriate. Do not fabricate events or dialogue. If a difficult event is essential, describe it gently and with hope.

# Length exception (biographies only)
Biographical pages may be approximately 350 words total (overrides the general 250-word guidance for these pages only).
