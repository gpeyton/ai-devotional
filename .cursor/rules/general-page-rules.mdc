Rules for drafting all pages:

# Tone
This is a children's book for ages 3–5. Use an age-appropriate tone: very simple, concrete language; short sentences (about 8–12 words); familiar words; explain or avoid big terms; warm and gentle but never condescending. Keep strong variety across days. Try to use illustrations wherever possible - at least one per day. If you use an illustration, weave it seamlessly into the lesson with smooth transitions (avoid abrupt shifts between unrelated images). 

Guidance for ages 3–5:
- Use present tense and direct address (you/we) where natural
- Keep one idea per sentence and one main idea per paragraph
- Prefer concrete over abstract words; define necessary big words briefly
- Avoid theological jargon unless immediately explained in child-friendly words

Always check your content for common AI writing patterns and reword them to sound more human-like. Do not make paragraphs too short lest the tone be stilted. Retain a cohesive train of thought and end each day's content elegantly. 

Don't always start each day with a question. Mix the style up for each day. Be original. Each day must be unique. 

# Illustrations
Illustrations may be: literary llustrations, historical stories, anecdotes, metaphores, literary pictures. Do not use stories you have made up about named people, but it is ok to use hypothetic scenarious. Example:
- WRONG: Imagine a young boy named Thomas who loved building with blocks. One day...
- RIGHT: Imagine playing a game of hide and seek with one of your brothers or sisters...

# Content
-Since this is a children's book, it needs to be engaging, dynamic and interesting. 

Do not repeat the same sentences, phrases and ideas between days. Keep it diverse and ensure that each day follows a different theme. For example, if theme for the week is creation, talk about the wonder of the creation on day 1 and the vastness of the creation on day 3. I.e. use diverse ideas. 

For example, don't do this:
<day 1>
Have you ever gone outside on a clear night and looked up at the stars? They shine like tiny diamonds scattered across a dark blanket. Or perhaps you've watched a sunset, with colors of orange, pink, and purple painted across the sky. When we see these beautiful sights, we're seeing God's artwork!
</day 1>
<day 3>
Have you ever stood outside on a clear night and looked up at the stars? They stretch so far into the sky that we can't count them all! Or have you peered through a magnifying glass at a tiny bug and marveled at its intricate legs and wings? From the biggest things to the tiniest things, God made them all!
</day 3>

# Theological position
All content must conform theologically the position held within the Westminster Shorter Catechism

# Length
Make each page 200–250 words total (strict) excluding heading and introductory verses. Biographical pages are exempt; see the biography length exception.

# Structure
See rules for each section

# Source of truth for verses and hymns
- If an index or existing page already specifies a verse or hymn, preserve it exactly. Do not change preselected verses/hymns unless explicitly asked.
- If a preselected verse appears to conflict with a section guideline (e.g., Wisdom day normally uses Proverbs/Ecclesiastes), keep the preselected verse and optionally flag it for review rather than changing it.

# Catechism language (modernized for children ages 3–5)
When including Westminster Shorter Catechism questions and answers, abbreviate and modernize the wording into clear, child-friendly English. Use short sentences, familiar vocabulary, and active voice while preserving the doctrinal meaning.

Example:
Original
Question: Who is the Redeemer of God's elect?
Answer: The only Redeemer of God's elect is the Lord Jesus Christ, who, being the eternal Son of God, became man, and so was, and continueth to be, God and man in two distinct natures, and one person, forever.

Child-friendly
Question: Who saves God’s chosen people?
Answer: Jesus Christ, God’s eternal Son, is the only Savior. He became a man and is both God and man in one person forever.

# Hymns and Songs
Prefer not to use sentimental hymns or songs.

The Creator

Weekly Memory Verse: "In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth." (Genesis 1:1)

Question 1: Who made you?
Answer: God made me.

Have you ever watched a potter making something beautiful from clay? In the Bible, God tells us He is like a potter, and we are like clay in His hands. Just as a potter carefully shapes each pot to be special and unique, God has made each one of us with great care and love.

The story of creation in Genesis tells us that God made everything we see - the vast oceans, the towering mountains, the twinkling stars, and all the animals. But do you know what's most amazing? When God made people, He did something extra special. The Bible says He made us in His own image! This means we can think, create, love, and know God in a way that's different from all other creatures.

Think about the great astronomer Johannes Kepler. When he studied the stars and planets through his telescope, he said he was "thinking God's thoughts after Him." He discovered amazing things about how the planets move, and it made him praise God for being such a wonderful Creator. Just like Kepler, when we look at the world around us, we can see signs of God's creativity everywhere.

Even the tiniest things show God's careful design. Scientists have found that every snowflake has its own unique pattern - no two are exactly alike! Just like those snowflakes, God made each of us unique and special. He gave you your own special abilities, your own way of smiling, and your own way of showing love to others.

The missionary Amy Carmichael understood this well. When she was a little girl in Ireland, she prayed for God to change her brown eyes to blue. But God had made her just as He wanted her to be. Later, when she became a missionary in India, those brown eyes helped her rescue many children because she could blend in with the local people. God had a special plan when He made her, just as He has a special plan for each of us.

Hymn: This Is My Father's World

Prayer Points:
• Thank God for making us in His image
• Praise God for His wonderful creation
• Ask God to help us use our special gifts for His glory
