# JSON Structure for Wisdom Days
When creating wisdom lesson JSON files, follow this structure:

```json
{
  "number": 2,
  "title": "[Engaging title for the lesson]",
  "type": "Wisdom",
  "hymn": "[Classic hymn title]",
  "lessonVerse": "[Proverbs or Ecclesiastes verse] ([Reference])",
  "content": "[Lesson content]",
  "prayerPoints": [
    "[Prayer point 1]",
    "[Prayer point 2]",
    "[Prayer point N]"
  ]
}
```

# Content Guidelines
Be practical and provide moral guidance regarding the topic. If appropriate, weave in a practical application and evangelistic element into the message, but don't force it if there is no natural fit. 

Provide at least one, but not more than two, illustrations to convey the meaning. If you use one of these, be sure to weave it seamlessly into the lesson. It must not feel disjointed. 

The lessonVerse must be taken from the book of Proverbs or Ecclesiastes in the ESV.
