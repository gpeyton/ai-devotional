# Page Structure
The following structure must be followed when drafting the page. 

# Content
Be practical and provide moral guidance regarding the topic. If appropriate, weave in a practical application and evangelistic element into the message, but don't force it if there is no natural fit. 

Provide at least one, but not more than two, illustrations to convey the meaning. If you use one of these, be sure to weave it seamlessly into the lesson. It must not feel disjointed. 

The <lesson verse> must be taken from the book of Proberbs or Ecclesiastes in the ESV.
