# Page Structure
The following structure must be followed when drafting the page. You can use between 2 to 4 prayer points:

# Content
Your task is to explain and teach the catechism question/answer to a child. Structure the lesson in an engaging, flowing manner that holds attention. If appropriate, weave in a practical application and evangelistic element into the message, but don't force it if there is no natural fit. 

Provide at least one, but not more than two, illustrations to convey the meaning. If you use one of these, be sure to weave it seamlessly into the lesson. It must not feel disjointed.
