# JSON Structure for Catechism Days
When creating catechism lesson JSON files, follow this structure:

```json
{
  "number": [1 or 3],
  "title": "[Engaging title for the lesson]",
  "type": "Catechism",
  "hymn": "[Classic hymn title]",
  "catechism": {
    "questionNumber": [sequential WSC number],
    "question": "[Rewrite catechism question for children]",
    "answer": "[Rewrite catechism answer for children]"
  },
  "content": "[Lesson content]",
  "prayerPoints": [
    "[Prayer point 1]",
    "[Prayer point 2]",
    "[Prayer point 3]"
  ]
}
```

# Content Guidelines
Your task is to explain and teach the catechism question/answer to a child. Structure the lesson in an engaging, flowing manner that holds attention. If appropriate, weave in a practical application and evangelistic element into the message, but don't force it if there is no natural fit. 

Provide at least one, but not more than two, illustrations to convey the meaning. If you use one of these, be sure to weave it seamlessly into the lesson. It must not feel disjointed. 

Make sure to rewrite the questions/answer with modernized, child-friendly wording (ages 3â€“5). I.e. shorten sentences, use familiar words, but retain doctrinal completelness. Example: 
- Original: "Who is the Redeemer of God's elect? ... continueth to be ..."
- Child-friendly: "Who saves God's chosen people? ... Jesus Christ ... is both God and man in one person forever."

# Content Array Structure
Break the lesson into 6-8 paragraph strings in the content array. Each paragraph should be 2-4 sentences focusing on one main idea. You can use between 2 to 4 prayer points.

# Verse Format Examples
Weekly Memory Verse: "In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth." (Gen 1:1)
