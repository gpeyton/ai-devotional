# JSON Structure for Catechism Days
When creating catechism lesson JSON files, follow this example structure:

```json
{
    "number": 4,
    "title": "God's Creativity",
    "type": "Attribute",
    "hymn": "All Creatures of Our God and King",
    "attribute": "Creative",
    "lessonVerse": "How many are Your works, Lord! In wisdom You made them all; the earth is full of Your creatures. (Psalm 104:24)",
    "content": "[Lesson content]",
    "prayerPoints": [
        "[Prayer point 1]",
        "[Prayer point 2]",
        "[Prayer point 3]"
    ]
}
```

# Content
use the verse as a basis to explains and extols the attribute of God listed. If appropriate, weave in a practical application and evangelistic element into the message, but don't force it if there is no natural fit. 

Provide at least one, but not more than two, illustrations to convey the meaning. If you use one of these, be sure to weave it seamlessly into the lesson. It must not feel disjointed. 

The <lesson verse> must be taken from the ESV. If needed, it's OK to use additional verses to substantiate your points.

# Verse Format Examples
Weekly Memory Verse: "In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth." (Gen 1:1)
Lesson Verse: "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God." (John 1:1)
