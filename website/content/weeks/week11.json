          "God made a similar agreement with Adam in the Garden of Eden. God said to Adam, \"You can eat from every tree in the garden except one—the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. If you obey me and don't eat from that tree, you will live forever in this beautiful garden with me.\"",
          "This was called the covenant of works because Adam had to do something (obey God's command) to receive the blessing (living forever with God). It was actually a very easy thing for Adam to do—just don't eat from one tree when there were so many other wonderful trees to enjoy!",

The snow was so thick that he couldn't get there! Instead, he ducked into a tiny chapel in the town of Colchester to get warm.",
          "The regular preacher couldn't come because of the storm. A simple man stood up to speak instead. He wasn't fancy or highly educated, but he opened his Bible and read these words: \"Look unto me, and be ye saved\" from Isaiah 45:22. Then he looked straight at young Charles and said, \"Young man, you look miserable. Look to Jesus Christ and be saved!\" Right there, Charles trusted Jesus as his Savior.",
          "From that day on, Charles loved reading his Bible and talking to God in prayer. Soon he began telling small groups about Jesus. When he was only nineteen years old in 1854, he became the pastor of a church in London called New Park Street Chapel. So many people came to hear him preach that they had to build a much bigger building called the Metropolitan Tabernacle. Sometimes six thousand people packed in to hear him!",
          "Charles didn't just preach. He cared for people who needed help. He started an orphanage to take care of children who had no families. He opened a school to train young men to become preachers. He wrote many books and sermons so people could learn about Jesus at home. People called him the \"Prince of Preachers\" because God used his words to help so many hearts.",
          "What was Charles's favorite message? The same simple truth he heard as a boy: Look to Jesus and be saved! He never grew tired of telling people about God's love. He preached about our memory verse often, reminding everyone that God gave His Son so we could live forever.",
          "We can be like Charles in simple ways. We can listen carefully when we hear God's Word. We can thank God for His love every day. We can tell a friend, \"Look to Jesus!\" God loves to use ordinary people like us to share His extraordinary love."
