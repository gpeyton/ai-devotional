          "The best way to glorify God is to love Him with all our heart and do what He tells us in His Word, the Bible. It's like when your parents ask you to clean your room or be kind to your brother or sister. When you obey with a happy heart, it shows you love them!",
          "King David in the Bible loved God very much. He wrote, \"I delight to do your will, O my God; your law is within my heart\" (Psalm 40:8). David knew that obeying God wasn't just about following rules—it was a way to show his love.",
          "When we read our Bibles, pray, sing songs about God, tell others about Jesus, and try to be kind and helpful, we are glorifying God. Even small things like sharing your toys or saying \"thank you\" can bring glory to God when you do them out of love for Him.",
          "Jesus said the most important commandment is to \"love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind\" (Matthew 22:37). When we do this, we are glorifying God in the very best way!"

They had to listen to church leaders tell them what God said, but sometimes these leaders didn't explain things right.",

          "William Tyndale's words are still in our Bibles today. Phrases like \"the salt of the earth\" and \"let there be light\" came from his translation. Every time we read the Bible in English, we can thank God for brave William Tyndale who gave his life so we could read God's Word."
