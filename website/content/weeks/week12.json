While other children played games, Jane could often be found reading her Bible or studying Latin and Greek so she could understand God's Word even better!",
          "Jane was born into a very important family in 1537. Her great-uncle was King Henry VIII! This meant Jane lived in beautiful castles and wore fancy dresses. But what made Jane special wasn't her royal blood—it was her royal love for Jesus.",
          "When Jane was only nine years old, she was already reading the Bible in both Latin and Greek. She loved learning about God so much that she would rather study Scripture than play with toys. Her tutor said she was one of the smartest children he had ever met!",
          "As Jane grew up, something sad was happening in England. Some people wanted the country to stop following Jesus and return to old, wrong ways of worshiping. But Jane knew that Jesus was the only way to God, and she refused to change her mind, even when powerful people told her she must.",
          "When Jane was only 15 years old, some adults made her the Queen of England for nine days! But she didn't want to be queen just to have power. She wanted to use her position to help people know and love Jesus. Unfortunately, other people who didn't love Jesus took the crown away from her.",
          "The saddest part of Jane's story is that when she was only 16 years old, she was told she must give up believing in Jesus or she would die. Jane had a choice: save her life by denying Jesus, or stay faithful to Him even if it cost her everything.",
          "Jane thought about Jesus, who had died for her sins. She remembered how much He loved her. She decided that loving Jesus was more important than anything else in the world—even her own life. 'I will not deny my Savior,' she said bravely.",
          "Jane was willing to die rather than stop believing in Jesus. On February 12, 1554, at only 16 years old, she gave her life because she would not stop loving Jesus. Jane's courage shows us that Jesus is worth more than anything else in the world.",
          "Though Jane's life was short, her faith was enormous. She reminds us that even young people can love Jesus with all their hearts and be willing to follow Him no matter what. What a wonderful example of courage and faith!"
