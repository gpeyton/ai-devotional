          "But something sad happened. Satan, who hates God and hates people, came to Eve disguised as a serpent. He whispered lies to her: \"Did God really say you can't eat from that tree? You won't die if you eat it. You'll become like God!\"",
          "Eve listened to these lies instead of remembering God's true words. She looked at the fruit and thought it looked good to eat. She took some and ate it, then gave some to Adam, who was with her. Adam knew it was wrong, but he ate it too.",

          "This was the first sin, and it broke everything. Death entered the world, just as God had warned. But even in this dark moment, God had a plan to fix what sin had broken. He would send a Savior!"

          "David was born in Scotland in 1813 to a very poor family. When he was just 10 years old, he had to work in a cotton mill for 12 hours every day to help his family earn money. But David had a big dream: he wanted to become a doctor and a missionary.",
          "Even though David worked long hours, he studied every chance he got. He would prop a book up on the spinning machine and read while he worked! After work, he went to school until late at night. His determination paid off—he became both a doctor and a minister.",
          "In 1840, when David was 27, he sailed to Africa with the London Missionary Society. Africa was largely unknown to people in Europe at that time. Many areas had never been explored, and there were no maps to guide travelers.",
          "David wasn't just interested in exploring—his heart was full of love for the African people. He wanted them to know about Jesus' love and salvation. As he traveled, he learned local languages, treated sick people, and told everyone he met about God's amazing grace.",
          "For 30 years, David explored Africa, mapping over one million square miles of unknown territory! He discovered huge waterfalls, which he named Victoria Falls after Queen Victoria. He found the source of the Nile River. But most importantly, he shared the Gospel with thousands of people.",
          "David faced incredible dangers. He was attacked by a lion that crushed his shoulder. He caught malaria over 20 times. He walked thousands of miles in scorching heat and torrential rains. But nothing could stop him from his mission to share Jesus' love.",
          "In 1871, the world wondered what had happened to David—no one had heard from him for years! A journalist named Henry Stanley was sent to find him. When Stanley finally found David in a small village, he said the famous words: 'Dr. Livingstone, I presume?'",
          "David died in Africa in 1873, kneeling beside his bed in prayer. The African people who loved him carried his body over 1,000 miles to the coast so he could be buried in England. They said, 'This man loved us and told us about the God who loves us.' What a wonderful legacy of faithfulness!"
